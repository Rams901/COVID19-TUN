# COVID19-TUN
Greetings, 
This is a prototpye for a model that will predict infections in Tunisia.
I've used the publicly-available data from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), which is updated on a daily-basis.
You can find the code at the main.py file. This is just a prototype and is based on a worst case scenario for Tunisia.
